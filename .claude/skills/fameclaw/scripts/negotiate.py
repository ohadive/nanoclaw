Great to hear from you! Really appreciate the response.

Before we put something together, a few quick questions:

1. Could you share your audience demographics? Specifically top countries and age/gender split.
2. What are your rates for a video integration? Do you offer discounts for multiple videos?
3. Have any examples of past brand collabs you've done?

That's a bit above our current budget for a single integration. A couple thoughts:

2. Or would you be open to a performance/affiliate model instead? We'd pay a base + commission on conversions.
